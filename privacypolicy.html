<h2>Our Privacy Policy:</h2>
Welcome to the Mobile application (defined below) and web site (the “Site”) of Bahri Meriç CANLI. (“Bahri CANLI”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). The Site is operated by Bahri CANLI and this Privacy Policy has been created to provide information about our company and its content directory, tools, and applications (together with the Site, the “Mobile application”) to our users (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Bahri CANLI’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of the Mobile application.

<h2>Information We Collect:</h2>
When you interact with us through the Mobile application, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
<br>
<h2>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</h2> We collect Personal Data (such as name, gender and location) from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Mobile application, use certain Mobile applications, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever Bahri CANLI collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. We also collect device information such as IP address, geo-location, language, device ID, operating system version, memory and sound card data, and installed media players to assist with providing you technical support.
<br>
<h2>Location-based Data:</h2> Bahri CANLI does not collect your zip code, postal code, city or country unless you choose to provide this information to us at registration. Your general geo-location is collected at regular intervals if you use the Service on your mobile device; Bahri CANLI collects this information to provide content and services that are customized for your geographic area.
<br>
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Bahri CANLI and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
<br>
<h2>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:</h2> When you interact with Bahri CANLI through the Mobile application, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Bahri CANLI may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Bahri CANLI affiliates, agents or service providers. Bahri CANLI may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Mobile application. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Mobile application, Bahri CANLI often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Bahri CANLI may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Bahri CANLI may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
<br>
In operating the Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.

<h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>

We store your operating system version, memory and sound card data, and installed media players to assist us in providing you with technical support. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Mobile application, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Bahri CANLI and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Mobile application, such as listening preferences and other mobile application usage information, to help us improve the content and functionality of the Mobile application, to better understand our users and to improve the Mobile application. Bahri CANLI and its Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>
